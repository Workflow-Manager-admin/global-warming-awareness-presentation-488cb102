# What is Global Warming?

**Global warming** is the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities—primarily fossil fuel burning—which increases greenhouse gas levels.

- Driven by greenhouse effect
- Linked to industrialization
- Distinct from short-term weather

<footer>Defining the crisis</footer>

<!--
Global warming is not the same as climate variability or short-term weather changes.
Discuss the difference in presenter mode.

# Causes of Global Warming

## Main Contributors

- **Burning fossil fuels:** coal, oil, and natural gas
- **Deforestation**
- **Industrial processes**
- **Agriculture and livestock**

<!--
Fossil fuel use since the industrial revolution is the dominant cause.

  <div>
    Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms Earth’s surface.<br />
    Greenhouse gases trap part of the outgoing heat, warming the planet.

<!--
Key greenhouse gases: CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor.

# Impacts of Global Warming

- 🌡️ Higher average temperatures
- 🌊 Melting ice caps & sea level rise
- 🔥 More frequent extreme weather (heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes)
- 🌾 Threats to agriculture & food security
- 🐧 Biodiversity decline

# Evidence: Global Temperature Rise

![Global Temperature Rise Graph](https://climate.nasa.gov/system/news_items/main_images/3017_surface_temp_lines_bars_web_version.png)

- Average global surface temperature (1880–2020)
- Last decade: warmest in recorded history

# Solutions We Can Implement

- Shift to **renewable energy** (solar, wind, hydro)
- Improve **energy efficiency**
- Support **reforestation**
- Promote **sustainable agriculture**
- Reduce, reuse, recycle

<div style="color: #43A047; font-weight: bold; margin-top:8px;">
  Every action counts!
</div>

# What Can You Do?

- Save energy at home & work
- Use public transit, cycle, or walk
- Eat less meat and waste less food
- Support climate-friendly policies
- Spread awareness!

<footer>Be part of the change</footer>

<!--
Mention local initiatives if pertinent.

# International Efforts

- **Paris Agreement** (2015): Targets ≤2°C warming
- **UN Sustainable Development Goals**
- Carbon trading & emissions caps

# Myths vs. Facts

| Myth | Fact |
|---|---|
| "Climate change is natural" | Human activity is the main driver since 1850s |
| "It’s too late to act" | Every fraction of a degree matters |
| "Cold weather disproves warming" | Global =/= local, trends vs. anomalies |

<footer>Critical thinking matters</footer>

# Our Future: Act Now!

Without action:  
- +2°C–4°C rise possible by 2100  
- Catastrophic weather, food and water crises

With action:  
- Cleaner air, economic innovation, safer future

<div style="color: #1976D2; font-weight:bold; margin-top:14px;">
  The choice is ours.  
  <br>Start Now.
